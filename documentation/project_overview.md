# Project Overview — Restricting Access to Azure Virtual Network (TBS, 2022)

This project focused on securing Azure Virtual Network resources for the Social Housing Association (TBS) by limiting access exclusively to trusted users. The goal was to protect virtual machines and network services from unauthorized access while maintaining low operational cost and simplicity of management.

The project introduced:
- network segmentation,
- NSG-based access control,
- IP-based trust model,
- preparation for Azure Bastion,
- monitoring of rejected traffic.

The solution significantly increased security and aligned the environment with GDPR and internal IT policies.
